# FACSIMILE Documentation

This page contains documentation for the FACtor Score IteM reductIon with Lasso Estimator (FACSIMILE) package. FACSIMILE is a method for approximating sum scores, subscale scores, or factor scores based on reduced item sets. Given a scenario where a large number of items are available to measure a latent trait, FACSIMILE selects a subset of items that can be used to approximate the variable that would be obtained if all items were used.
